                                    <p> Hello. My name is Artem and I'm developing a blockchain-based app designed to
                                        transform how we interact with
                                        music. Focusing on independent and underrepresented artists, this platform uses
                                        Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to directly connect musicians with their audience,
                                        ensuring fair compensation and copyright integrity. Unlike mainstream services,
                                        my project emphasizes niche genres and aims to introduce listeners to a wider
                                        diversity of sounds. By integrating blockchain technology, I'm not just building
                                        an app but pioneering a more equitable and transparent music industry. This
                                        journey is about creating a new space where music and technology meet to empower
                                        both creators and fans.</p>

                                    <div class="blog-detials-pra-title" id="week-1">Week 1:
                                        Choosing a technology Stack.</div>

                                    <div>
                                        <p>In the first week of my journey to build a blockchain-based music platform,
                                            I've been diving deep into the critical task of choosing the right
                                            technology stack. It's a decision that feels as foundational as laying down
                                            the first brick of a house – everything else will be built upon it. So,
                                            here's how I've been approaching this crucial phase.</p>
                                    </div>

                                    <div>
                                        <h1>Frontend Decisions</h1>

                                        <p>I've already settled on React JS for the web interface as I have experience
                                            using it. Its component-based nature is a perfect fit for the dynamic and
                                            engaging UI I envision. React's vast ecosystem and community support mean
                                            I'm never too far from finding a solution or a new idea to implement.</p>
                                    </div>

                                    <div>
                                        <h1>Mobile App Development</h1>
                                        <p>Choosing the right framework for the mobile app was a challenging decision –
                                            <strong>Flutter or React Native? Why
                                                React Native?</strong>
                                        </p>

                                        <p><strong>Development Speed:</strong> React Native allows for a shared codebase
                                            with the web platform, streamlining
                                            the development process, similarly to Flutter.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Performance:</strong> Flutter compiles to native code, which can lead
                                            to better performance in some scenarios. This performance edge can be
                                            particularly important for apps with complex animations or where device
                                            hardware access is critical.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Community:</strong> React Native (2015), being older, has a larger
                                            and more established community compared to Flutter (2017), meaning that I
                                            will be more likely to find solutions to the problems I will come across.
                                        </p>
                                        <p><strong>Previous Experience:</strong> I have used React JS before, which
                                            shares the same concepts of components, state management, and props that are
                                            fundamental to building dynamic user interfaces.</p>


                                        <p>Despite <strong>Flutter's</strong> performance advantages and growing
                                            popularity, I've chosen <strong>React Native</strong> for its extensive
                                            community, familiarity and a smoother learning curve.</p>

                                    </div>

                                    <p>After deciding that I will use React Native. I completed a Codecademy Course.</p>

                                        <h1>Building the Backend</h1>

                                        <p>The backend part of the project is what I consider to be the most
                                            challenging. It will be responsible for complicated tasks such as NFT
                                            creation and Marketplace operations, uploading and streaming tracks. </p>

                                        <h2>User Authentication: A Dual Approach</h2>
                                        <p><strong>Firebase Authentication:</strong> This has been my go-to for managing
                                            sign-ins via Gmail, thanks to its ease of setup and broad integration with
                                            various login methods. It provides a quick and secure way to handle user
                                            authentication.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Web3 Libraries:</strong> For users who want access to the crypto part
                                            of the app, I plan to use libraries like Web3.js and ethers.js to bridge
                                            their Ethereum wallets with our platform. This integration is vital for
                                            linking activities like NFT transactions and minting directly to their
                                            blockchain wallet.</p>

                                        <h2>Music Streaming and User Engagement</h2>
                                        <p><strong>Firebase's Firestore:</strong> I'm leveraging Firestore for its
                                            real-time data handling capabilities, utilizing it to store user data,
                                            playlists, and song metadata. This ensures the platform remains dynamic and
                                            responsive.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Firebase Cloud Storage:</strong> This will act as the music file
                                            repository, providing the scalability and reliability needed for streaming.
                                            It's crucial to ensure all hosted music is legally uploaded by its creators
                                            or those with who have the rights.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Custom Backend APIs:</strong> Developed with Node.js and Express.js,
                                            these APIs will facilitate various user actions like curating playlists and
                                            marking favorites, bridging the database and user interface.</p>

                                        <h2>The NFT Marketplace - Creativity Plus Commerce</h2>
                                        <p><strong>Smart Contracts:</strong> Utilizing Solidity, I'm setting up the
                                            base for the NFT transactions, which will handle the minting, sale, and
                                            transfer processes on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
                                        <p><strong>IPFS:</strong> For decentralized storage of the actual music files
                                            linked to NFTs, IPFS presents a fitting solution that aligns with the
                                            blockchain's decentralized nature.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Web3.js and ethers.js Integration:</strong> This integration will
                                            allow the platform to interact with the smart contracts, enabling
                                            functionalities from NFT minting to marketplace transactions.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Marketplace System:</strong> A crucial component of the platform,
                                            this system will enable users to list, sell, and buy NFTs, fostering a
                                            community where creative value is acknowledged and rewarded.</p>

                                            It is useful to outline that the NFT will act more in the form of a donation
                                            rather than a proof of ownership. They will be associated with a track but
                                            that doesn't mean the person who owns the NFT owns the track. The artist
                                            retains full ownership of the track and the right to upload the track to any
                                            other platforms.

                                            In the second week of my project. I have decided to developed a functional
                                            prototype.
                                            I decided to do it as a proof of concept, to make sure that this project
                                            would be feasible. Given the limited
                                            time I have to make the project I wanted to understand the technical
                                            challenges and potential limitations as soon as possible, so that i have
                                            enough time to adapt and overcome them.

                                            By developing the prototype I am laying the groundwork for my application.

                                        <h1>Errors</h1>
                                        <p>
                                            In the process of developing my project, I encountered a significant
                                            challenge related to package compatibility. As I integrated various
                                            functionalities into the main codebase, I discovered that certain packages,
                                            which performed flawlessly in isolation, were not compatible with others.
                                            This necessitated a thorough review of documentation and extensive research
                                            online to identify which packages could work together. During the research,
                                            I identified that I was using an outdated version of Wagmi (a package
                                            used to interact with the crypto wallet), which
                                            added to the complexity of the situation. This experience underscored the
                                            importance of carefully selecting and updating packages to ensure smooth
                                            integration and optimal functionality in a project.

                                            Another significant error I encountered in my project involved NFT creation.
                                            Despite successfully uploading the metadata to Etherscan, I faced an issue:
                                            the image and sound associated with the NFT failed to
                                            appear on the OpenSea testnet. This problem occurred while I was using the
                                            Sepolia test network, even thought the metadata of the NFT was correct and
                                            accessible (checked on etherscan), as well as the smart contract the image
                                            and audio still didn't show.
                                            <img src="./images/images/Nft_metadata.jpeg" alt="">
                                            After research I have found the possible problems that can be causing this
                                            behavior.The indexing of the NFT can take some time (not more than 24 hrs).
                                            Test networks don't support image and audio NFTs.
                                            After 24 hours the nft did not appear, so I decided to switch to a Polygon
                                            main network. The difference between main networks and text networks, is
                                            that test networks are free and you can get the cryptocurrency needed to use
                                            smart contracts, NFTs and all the other blockchain features from faucets,
                                            which is free. The Polygon network is not free, but very cheap.
                                            <img src="./images/images/reddit_polygon.PNG" alt="">
                                            The experiment was successful. Both the image and the audio file appeared on
                                            the blockchain almost instantly.

                                            In the final prototype the user has the ability to select which audio clip
                                            the NFT will hold. The user has to upload the audio clip first to me able to
                                            select it. This imitates, the process of uploading and creating NFTs by the
                                            artist. Currently I am using json file to store the NFT metadata, but in the
                                            application I wil use the IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for
                                            decentralized file
                                            storage,to make sure that the file is accessible.

                                            !!! Interesting finding. The NFT doesnt store the metadata (including the
                                            image) on the blockchain it stores it in a remote location as a json file,
                                            which provides the links to the image, audio, animation and everything else
                                            that an NFT might have. So essential if that location because unaccessible
                                            for what ever reason, the NFT will not be ble to point to the image that it
                                            represent, in some cases that might mean that the NFT becomes worthless.

                                            Solidity, smart contracts and the future of the internet.
                                            Solidity is the programming language that is used to write smart contracts.
                                            A smart contract is like a set of rules written in computer code that
                                            automatically carries out an agreement between people. Imagine it as a
                                            vending machine: When you put the right amount of money in and select your
                                            snack, the machine automatically gives you the snack without needing anyone
                                            else to make sure the deal goes through.

                                            Currently I am using a very simple contract that is able to mint an NFT. I
                                            will need to create a smart contract that is able to create NFTs, transfer
                                            them from one wallet to another, and delete the NFT if the user decides
                                            that they don't want the NFT anymore.

                                            !!! Interesting finding. There ins't an way to delete an NFT once it is on
                                            the blockchain. The only way to delete or burn it is to send it to
                                            non-existent crypto wallet condemning the NFT to an eternal being
                                            somewhere in the depths of the blockchain. The blockchain reminds me of
                                            space in some ways and perhaps the only way to retrieve a burnt NFT is to
                                            create a wallet with the same address as the non-existent address that it
                                            was sent to, hence becoming an existent address. But due to cryptographic
                                            principles that are used to create a wallet the chances of that happening
                                            are astronomically low but not zero.

                                            <br>
                                            Web3.0 is the next phase of the internet, where websites and apps will be
                                            able to process information in a smart, human-like way through technologies
                                            like artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain. This means the web will
                                            not just be a place to look up information, but also understand and interact
                                            with it in more complex ways. For example, Web3.0 could enable secure,
                                            direct, peer-to-peer transactions and agreements via blockchain and smart
                                            contracts, making the internet more decentralized and giving users more
                                            control over their data and online interactions. Essentially, Web3.0 aims to
                                            create a more personalized, secure, and intelligent internet.
