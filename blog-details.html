                                        <h2>The Foundation: Choosing A Tech Stack</h2>
                                        <p>In the first week of my journey to build a blockchain-based music platform,
                                            I've been diving deep into the critical task of choosing the right
                                            technology stack. It's a decision that feels as foundational as laying down
                                            the first brick of a house – everything else will be built upon it. So,
                                            here's how I've been approaching this crucial phase.</p>
                                    </div>

                                    <div>
                                        Frontend Decisions
                                        <p>I've already settled on React JS for the web interface as I have experience
                                            using it. Its component-based nature is a perfect fit for the dynamic and
                                            engaging UI I envision. React's vast ecosystem and community support mean
                                            I'm never too far from finding a solution or a new idea to implement.</p>
                                    </div>

                                    <div>
                                        Mobile App Development Decision
                                        <p>Choosing the right framework for the mobile app was a challenging decision –
                                            <strong>Flutter or React Native? Why
                                                React Native?</strong>
                                        </p>

                                        <p><strong>Development Speed:</strong> React Native allows for a shared codebase
                                            with the web platform, streamlining
                                            the development process, similarly to Flutter.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Performance:</strong> Flutter compiles to native code, which can lead
                                            to better performance in some scenarios. This performance edge can be
                                            particularly important for apps with complex animations or where device
                                            hardware access is critical.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Community:</strong> React Native (2015), being older, has a larger
                                            and more established community compared to Flutter (2017), meaning that I
                                            will be more likely to find solutions to the problems I will come across.
                                        </p>
                                        <p><strong>Previous Experience:</strong> I have used React JS before, which
                                            shares the same concepts of components, state management, and props that are
                                            fundamental to building dynamic user interfaces.</p>


                                        <p>Despite <strong>Flutter's</strong> performance advantages and growing
                                            popularity, I've chosen <strong>React Native</strong> for its extensive
                                            community, familiarity and a smoother learning curve.</p>

                                    </div>

                                    <p>After deciding that I will use React Native. I completed a Codecademy Course.</p>

                                    <div>Building the Backend

                                        <p>The backend part of the project is what I consider to be the most
                                            challenging. It will be responsible for complicated tasks such as NFT
                                            creation and Marketplace operations, uploading and streaming tracks. </p>

                                        <p><strong>Firebase Authentication:</strong> This has been my go-to for managing
                                            sign-ins via Gmail, thanks to its ease of setup and broad integration with
                                            various login methods. It provides a quick and secure way to handle user
                                            authentication.</p>

                                            of the app, I plan to use libraries like Web3.js and ethers.js to bridge
                                            their Ethereum wallets with our platform. This integration is vital for
                                            linking activities like NFT transactions and minting directly to their
                                            blockchain wallet.</p>

                                        <h2>Music Streaming and User Engagement</h2>
                                        <p><strong>Firebase's Firestore:</strong> I'm leveraging Firestore for its
                                            real-time data handling capabilities, utilizing it to store user data,
                                            playlists, and song metadata. This ensures the platform remains dynamic and
                                            responsive.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Firebase Cloud Storage:</strong> This will act as the music file
                                            repository, providing the scalability and reliability needed for streaming.
                                            It's crucial to ensure all hosted music is legally uploaded by its creators
                                            or those with who have the rights.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Custom Backend APIs:</strong> Developed with Node.js and Express.js,
                                            these APIs will facilitate various user actions like curating playlists and
                                            marking favorites, bridging the database and user interface.</p>

                                            transfer processes on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
                                        <p><strong>IPFS:</strong> For decentralized storage of the actual music files
                                            linked to NFTs, IPFS presents a fitting solution that aligns with the
                                            blockchain's decentralized nature.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Web3.js and ethers.js Integration:</strong> This integration will
                                            allow the platform to interact with the smart contracts, enabling
                                            functionalities from NFT minting to marketplace transactions.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Marketplace System:</strong> A crucial component of the platform,
                                            this system will enable users to list, sell, and buy NFTs, fostering a
                                            community where creative value is acknowledged and rewarded.</p>

                                            It is useful to outline that the NFT will act more in the form of a donation
                                            rather than a proof of ownership. They will be associated with a track but
                                            that doesn't mean the person who owns the NFT owns the track. The artist
                                            retains full ownership of the track and the right to upload the track to any
                                            other platforms.
